# Exercise 2 – Function Completion

Use Copilot to implement the functions in **functions.py**.  
Try these steps:

* Read each docstring – it tells Copilot what the function should do.
* Inside the function body, write a short comment such as `# TODO: implement`.
* Press **Enter** and watch Copilot propose a full implementation.
* Accept or cycle through suggestions, then run `python functions.py` to test.

Challenge: tweak the docstring wording and observe how the generated code changes.
