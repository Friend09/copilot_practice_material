# GitHub Copilot Mastery: Your 30-Day Learning Roadmap

This roadmap provides a structured path to mastering GitHub Copilot in VS Code. It combines theoretical knowledge with practical, hands-on exercises and real-world projects to ensure you gain proficiency within a month.

## How to Use This Roadmap

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the `github-copilot-practice` repository to your local machine.
2.  **Set Up Your Environment**: Ensure you have VS Code and the GitHub Copilot extension installed and configured as per the `beginner/reading/02-setup-and-configuration.md` guide.
3.  **Follow the Daily Schedule**: Each day has specific reading materials and exercises. Stick to the schedule for consistent progress.
4.  **Practice Consistently**: Dedicate at least 30-60 minutes daily to the exercises. The more you practice, the faster you will learn.
5.  **Review and Reflect**: After each exercise or reading section, take a moment to review what you've learned and how Copilot assisted you.
6.  **Build Projects**: The weekly projects are crucial for applying your knowledge in a more integrated way. Don't skip them!
7.  **Experiment**: Don't be afraid to try different prompts, explore Copilot's suggestions, and even intentionally break things to understand how they work.
