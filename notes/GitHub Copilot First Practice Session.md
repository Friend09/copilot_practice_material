## 🎨 Effective Prompt Engineering

### The Golden Rules of Prompting

1. **Be Specific** - Vague prompts = vague results
2. **Provide Context** - Include expected inputs/outputs
3. **Use Examples** - Show what you want
4. **Break It Down** - Complex tasks into smaller steps
5. **Iterate** - Refine prompts based on results

### Powerful Prompting Patterns

#### 1. The Function Template Pattern

```python
# Create a function that validates email addresses and returns True/False
# Parameters: email (string) - the email to validate
# Example: validate_email("user@domain.com") -> True
# Example: validate_email("invalid-email") -> False
```

#### 2. The Step-by-Step Pattern

```python
# Function to process CSV data:
# 1. Read CSV file from given path
# 2. Clean and normalize column names
# 3. Remove rows with missing critical data
# 4. Return processed DataFrame
```

#### 3. The Example-Driven Pattern

```python
# Convert temperature between units
# celsius_to_fahrenheit(0) -> 32.0
# celsius_to_fahrenheit(100) -> 212.0
# fahrenheit_to_celsius(32) -> 0.0
```

#### 4. The Constraint Pattern

```python
# Create a password generator function:
# - Must be 12 characters long
# - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
# - No ambiguous characters (0, O, l, 1)
# - Return as string
```

## 💻 Live Demonstration Examples

### Demo 1: Basic Function Creation

**Prompt:**

```python
# Create a function to calculate compound interest
# Principal: initial amount
# Rate: annual interest rate (as decimal)
# Time: number of years
# Compounding: number of times interest compounds per year
```

**Expected Copilot Generation:**

```python
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, compounding=1):
    """
    Calculate compound interest.

    Args:
        principal: Initial amount
        rate: Annual interest rate (as decimal)
        time: Number of years
        compounding: Times compounded per year (default: 1)

    Returns:
        Final amount after compound interest
    """
    amount = principal * (1 + rate/compounding) ** (compounding * time)
    return amount
```

### Demo 2: Data Structure Manipulation

**Prompt:**

```python
# Function to analyze sales data
# Input: list of dictionaries with keys: 'product', 'quantity', 'price'
# Output: dictionary with total_revenue, average_order_value, top_product
```

### Demo 3: API Integration

**Prompt:**

```python
# Create a function to fetch weather data from API
# Use requests library
# Handle errors gracefully
# Return temperature and description
```

### Demo 4: Testing Generation

**Prompt:**

```python
# Generate unit tests for the above compound interest function
# Include edge cases and error conditions
# Use pytest framework
```

## 🔧 Common Troubleshooting Issues

### Issue 1: No Suggestions Appearing

**Symptoms:** Copilot doesn't show any suggestions

**Quick Fixes:**

1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Copilot subscription is active
3. Look for Copilot icon in status bar
4. Try manual trigger: `Alt + \` (Windows) / `Option + \` (Mac)
5. Restart VS Code if needed

**Advanced Solutions:**

- Check extension is enabled for file type
- Review settings: `github.copilot.enable`
- Sign out and back in: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "GitHub Copilot: Sign Out"

### Issue 2: Poor Quality Suggestions

**Symptoms:** Suggestions don't match intent or are irrelevant

**Solutions:**

- Add more context in comments
- Provide specific examples of input/output
- Break complex requests into smaller parts
- Use more descriptive variable names
- Include relevant imports and dependencies

### Issue 3: Slow Performance

**Symptoms:** Long delays before suggestions appear

**Solutions:**

- Close unnecessary files in VS Code
- Check internet connection speed
- Use `.copilotignore` for large directories
- Increase suggestion delay in settings
- Exclude `node_modules` and build folders

### Issue 4: Authentication Problems

**Symptoms:** Repeated sign-in prompts

**Solutions:**

- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Use incognito mode for authentication
- Check organization restrictions
- Verify GitHub account has active subscription
- Contact IT if behind corporate firewall
