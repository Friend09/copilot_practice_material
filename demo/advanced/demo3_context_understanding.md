## Foundation Code

### Base Model Class

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any
from dataclasses import dataclass
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

@dataclass
class BaseModel:
    """
    Base model that Copilot will recognize and extend consistently
    across all services in the project
    """
    id: Optional[int] = None
    created_at: Optional[str] = None
    updated_at: Optional[str] = None

    def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Convert model to dictionary - Copilot will use this pattern"""
        return {k: v for k, v in self.__dict__.items() if v is not None}
```

### Abstract Service Pattern

```python
class BaseService(ABC):
    """
    Abstract service class that Copilot will understand as the
    architectural pattern for all microservices
    """

    def __init__(self, db_connection: Any):
        self.db = db_connection
        self.logger = self._setup_logging()

    @abstractmethod
    def create(self, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> BaseModel:
        """Copilot will implement this in each service"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_by_id(self, id: int) -> Optional[BaseModel]:
        """Copilot will implement this in each service"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def update(self, id: int, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[BaseModel]:
        """Copilot will implement this in each service"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def delete(self, id: int) -> bool:
        """Copilot will implement this in each service"""
        pass

    def _setup_logging(self):
        """Copilot will maintain consistent logging across services"""
        pass
```

### Domain Models

```python
@dataclass
class User(BaseModel):
    """
    User model - Copilot will understand this is referenced
    by orders and should maintain referential integrity
    """
    username: str
    email: str
    password_hash: str
    is_active: bool = True

@dataclass
class Product(BaseModel):
    """
    Product model - Copilot will understand inventory relationships
    and pricing strategies when generating related code
    """
    name: str
    description: str
    price: float
    category_id: int
    stock_quantity: int = 0

@dataclass
class Order(BaseModel):
    """
    Order model - Copilot will understand this aggregates
    users and products with business logic
    """
    user_id: int
    total_amount: float
    status: str = "pending"
    items: List[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

### Service Interfaces

```python
class UserServiceInterface:
    """
    Copilot will understand this defines the contract
    for user-related operations across the system
    """

    def authenticate_user(self, username: str, password: str) -> Optional[User]:
        pass

    def create_user(self, user_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> User:
        pass

    def get_user_orders(self, user_id: int) -> List[Order]:
        # Copilot will understand cross-service communication needed
        pass

class ProductServiceInterface:
    """
    Copilot will implement inventory management and
    understand the relationship with orders
    """

    def check_availability(self, product_id: int, quantity: int) -> bool:
        pass

    def reserve_items(self, items: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> bool:
        pass

    def update_inventory(self, product_id: int, quantity_change: int):
        pass

class OrderServiceInterface:
    """
    Copilot will understand this orchestrates user and product services
    """

    def create_order(self, user_id: int, items: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Order:
        pass

    def process_payment(self, order_id: int, payment_info: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        pass

    def fulfill_order(self, order_id: int) -> bool:
        pass
```

## üéØ Demo Instructions for Presenter

### 1. Setup the Demo (2 minutes)

- Show this file as the "architectural foundation"
- Explain that Copilot will understand these patterns
- Point out the interfaces and base classes

### 2. Demonstrate Context Awareness (15 minutes)

#### Step A: Create UserService

**Prompt to use:**

```text
Create a UserService class that implements UserServiceInterface
following the BaseService pattern defined in this file
```

**Expected Copilot behavior:**

- ‚úÖ Inherits from BaseService correctly
- ‚úÖ Implements all interface methods
- ‚úÖ Uses User model appropriately
- ‚úÖ Maintains consistent patterns

#### Step B: Create ProductService

**Prompt to use:**

```text
Create ProductService with inventory management, following
the same patterns as UserService
```

**Expected Copilot behavior:**

- ‚úÖ Follows same architectural pattern
- ‚úÖ Implements inventory logic
- ‚úÖ Uses Product model correctly
- ‚úÖ Maintains code consistency

#### Step C: Create OrderService

**Prompt to use:**

```text
Create OrderService that coordinates UserService and ProductService
for order processing
```

**Expected Copilot behavior:**

- ‚úÖ Understands service dependencies
- ‚úÖ Implements coordination logic
- ‚úÖ Handles cross-service communication
- ‚úÖ Maintains architectural integrity

### 3. Show Cross-File Understanding (8 minutes)

**Demonstrate that Copilot:**

- References the base classes correctly
- Maintains consistent patterns across services
- Understands service dependencies
- Suggests appropriate imports automatically

### 4. Demonstrate Architectural Awareness (8 minutes)

**Try these advanced prompts:**

```text
Add caching to all services
```

```text
Add rate limiting middleware
```

```text
Implement database migrations
```

```text
Add comprehensive logging
```

**Show how Copilot:**

- Applies changes consistently across services
- Understands architectural implications
- Maintains patterns and conventions

### 5. Show Intelligent Suggestions (5 minutes)

- Start typing a new method in one service
- Show how Copilot suggests consistent implementations
- Demonstrate understanding of business logic relationships

### 6. Test Cross-Service Logic (7 minutes)

**Final prompt:**

```text
Implement order creation that checks inventory, validates user,
processes payment, and handles rollbacks on failure
```

**Highlight how Copilot:**

- Understands the complete workflow
- Coordinates multiple services
- Handles error cases and rollbacks
- Maintains data consistency

## Success Metrics

After this demo, your audience should understand:

‚úÖ **Copilot thinks beyond single files** - It understands entire project context
‚úÖ **Architectural consistency is automatic** - Patterns are maintained across the codebase
‚úÖ **Complex workflows are understood** - Multi-service operations work seamlessly
‚úÖ **Business logic is preserved** - Domain knowledge is maintained
‚úÖ **Enterprise-ready suggestions** - Proper error handling, logging, and best practices

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Copilot doesn't maintain patterns

- Ensure you reference the base classes in your prompts
- Show the existing code context first
- Use more specific prompts about following "the established pattern"

### If cross-service logic fails

- Start with simpler service interactions
- Build complexity gradually
- Emphasize the coordination aspect in prompts

### If audience questions consistency

- Show the same prompt applied to different services
- Highlight how imports and references are handled automatically
- Demonstrate rollback of changes if needed

---

## Next Steps

After this demo, recommend:

1. **Try with their own codebase** - Show how it works with existing projects
2. **Establish team patterns** - Create base classes and interfaces for consistency
3. **Document architectural decisions** - Help Copilot understand team preferences
4. **Gradual adoption** - Start with new features, expand to refactoring

**üìÅ Files needed**: Save this markdown file and the foundation code snippets for easy reference during presentation.
