```python
import ast
import re
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any, Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime
from enum import Enum

# ‚ùå Code with various issues that Copilot will identify during review
class UserManager:
    """
    Sample class with code quality issues for review demonstration
    Copilot will identify multiple problems and suggest improvements
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}  # ‚ùå Using dict instead of proper data structure
        self.db_connection = None  # ‚ùå No dependency injection

    def createUser(self, name, email, password):  # ‚ùå Naming convention
        """‚ùå Missing type hints and proper validation"""
        if not name:  # ‚ùå Insufficient validation
            return False

        # ‚ùå Direct password storage (security issue)
        user_id = len(self.users) + 1  # ‚ùå Poor ID generation
        self.users[user_id] = {
            'name': name,
            'email': email,
            'password': password,  # ‚ùå Plain text password
            'created': datetime.now()
        }

        return user_id

    def get_user(self, user_id):  # ‚ùå Inconsistent naming, no error handling
        return self.users[user_id]  # ‚ùå KeyError potential

    def deleteUser(self, user_id):  # ‚ùå No soft delete, no cascading
        del self.users[user_id]  # ‚ùå Hard delete, no backup
        return True

    # ‚ùå Method doing too many things
    def authenticateAndGetProfile(self, email, password):
        for user_id, user in self.users.items():
            if user['email'] == email and user['password'] == password:  # ‚ùå Plain text comparison
                # ‚ùå Returning sensitive data
                return {
                    'id': user_id,
                    'name': user['name'],
                    'email': user['email'],
                    'password': user['password']  # ‚ùå Exposing password
                }
        return None
```

### Problematic Payment Processing Code

```python
# ‚ùå More problematic code for review
def process_payment(amount, card_number, cvv):  # ‚ùå Missing type hints, logging
    """‚ùå Security issues and poor error handling"""

    # ‚ùå No input validation
    if amount <= 0:
        return False

    # ‚ùå Hardcoded payment gateway details
    api_key = "sk_test_12345"  # ‚ùå Hardcoded secret

    # ‚ùå No encryption for sensitive data
    payment_data = {
        'amount': amount,
        'card': card_number,  # ‚ùå Storing card number
        'cvv': cvv,  # ‚ùå Storing CVV
        'api_key': api_key
    }

    # ‚ùå No try-catch, no logging
    response = make_payment_request(payment_data)  # ‚ùå Undefined function

    return response['success']  # ‚ùå Assumes response structure

# ‚ùå Function with performance issues
def find_users_by_criteria(users, criteria):  # ‚ùå No type hints
    """‚ùå Inefficient algorithm and no optimization"""
    results = []

    # ‚ùå O(n¬≤) complexity when could be O(n)
    for user_id, user in users.items():
        match = True
        for key, value in criteria.items():
            if key not in user or user[key] != value:
                match = False
                break
        if match:
            results.append(user)

    return results
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Copilot misses obvious issues

- Be more specific in your review request
- Ask for targeted analysis: "Focus on security vulnerabilities"
- Provide context about your coding standards
- Break large code blocks into smaller sections

### If suggestions are too generic

- Ask for specific examples: "Show me the corrected code"
- Request explanations: "Why is this approach better?"
- Ask for implementation details: "How should I implement this fix?"

### If PR summaries are incomplete

- Provide more context about the changes
- Ask for specific sections: "Generate testing notes for these changes"
- Request specific formats: "Follow our standard PR template"
