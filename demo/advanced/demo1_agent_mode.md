# GitHub Copilot Advanced Demo 1: Agent Mode & Multi-File Context

## Overview

This demo showcases GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode capabilities:

- **Autonomous multi-file code changes**
- **Context understanding across project structure**
- **Intelligent code iteration and validation**
- **Complex refactoring with dependency management**

## Demo Scenario

**E-commerce Product Management System** - Start with a simple product class and watch Copilot autonomously expand it into a complete system with multiple interconnected files.

🎯 **This demo shows Copilot working as an autonomous development partner!**

---

## Starting Point Code

### Basic Product Class

```python
class Product:
    """
    Basic product model that Copilot will enhance with:
    - Inventory management
    - Price history tracking
    - Category management
    - Search and filtering capabilities
    """

    def __init__(self, name: str, price: float):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Product: {self.name} - ${self.price}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Simple test to show the starting point
    product = Product("Demo Widget", 29.99)
    print(product)
    print("\n🚀 Ready for Copilot Agent Mode demonstration!")
```

## 🎯 Demo Instructions for Presenter

### 1. Setup the Demo (3 minutes)

- Show the basic Product class above as your starting point
- Explain that this single class will become a complete system
- Open Copilot Chat and prepare for the main prompt

### 2. Main Agent Mode Demonstration (15 minutes)

#### The Primary Prompt

**Use this exact prompt in Copilot Chat:**

```text
Create a complete e-commerce product management system with:
1. Product model with inventory tracking
2. Database operations with SQLAlchemy
3. REST API with FastAPI
4. Input validation with Pydantic
5. Error handling and logging
Please create multiple files and ensure they work together.
```

#### Expected Agent Mode Behaviors

│   ├── test_api.py
│   └── conftest.py
├── requirements.txt
└── main.py               # Application entry point
```

### 4. Follow-up Demonstrations (10 minutes)

Use these prompts to show iterative improvement:

#### Prompt 1: Add Authentication

```text
Add authentication middleware to the API
```

#### Prompt 2: Add Caching

```text
Implement caching for product queries
```

#### Prompt 3: Add Error Handling

```text
Add comprehensive error handling throughout the system
```

#### Prompt 4: Add Testing

```text
Add unit tests for all components
```

### 5. Show File Relationships (5 minutes)

- Open multiple generated files side by side
- Show how imports are handled correctly
- Demonstrate consistent patterns across files
- Highlight architectural coherence

- Use follow-up prompts to fill gaps

### If code quality is poor

- Be more specific about standards: "Following Python PEP 8 standards"
- Ask for best practices: "Include proper error handling and logging"
- Request documentation: "Add comprehensive docstrings"
- Specify frameworks: "Use SQLAlchemy ORM patterns"
