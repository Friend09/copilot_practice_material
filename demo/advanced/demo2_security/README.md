# Demo 2: AI-Based Vulnerability Detection

## What This Demo Shows

- **Real-time security analysis**: Copilot identifies vulnerabilities as you code
- **Comprehensive security review**: OWASP Top 10 and beyond
- **Secure alternatives**: Specific fixes with best practices
- **Proactive security**: Prevention during development, not after

**Duration**: 12-15 minutes
**Complexity**: Intermediate
**Best For**: Security-conscious audiences, development teams

---

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Copilot** subscription with Chat feature
2. **VS Code** with GitHub Copilot extensions
3. **Python 3.8+** installed
4. Basic understanding of web security concepts

---

## Quick Setup (1 minute)

### 1. Navigate to Demo Folder

```bash
cd demo/advanced/demo2_security
```

### 2. Review Vulnerable Code

Open `setup/vulnerable_code.py` - this contains intentional security issues!

⚠️ **Warning**: This code is intentionally vulnerable for demo purposes only!

### 3. Install Dependencies (Optional)

```bash
pip install -r setup/requirements.txt
```

---

## Demo Steps

### Step 1: Show Vulnerable Code (3 minutes)

1. Open `setup/vulnerable_code.py`
2. **Point out visible vulnerabilities** while scrolling:
   - Hardcoded secrets (lines 17-20)
   - Plain text passwords (line 39)
   - SQL injection (line 51)
   - Weak password hashing (line 75)

### Step 2: Security Analysis (8 minutes)

1. **Open Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I`)
2. **Copy primary prompt** from `prompts.md`:
   ```text
   Review this code for security vulnerabilities and fix them.
   Identify all security issues and provide secure alternatives.
   ```
3. **Watch Copilot identify**:
   - ✅ Hardcoded secrets → Environment variables
   - ✅ SQL injection → Parameterized queries
   - ✅ Weak cryptography → bcrypt/Argon2
   - ✅ Input validation issues → Comprehensive validation
   - ✅ Information disclosure → Proper error handling

### Step 3: Get Secure Implementations (4 minutes)

Use this follow-up prompt:

```text
Rewrite all the vulnerable functions using security best practices.
Include proper error handling, input validation, and secure defaults.
```

Watch Copilot provide:

- Environment variable usage
- Secure password hashing
- Parameterized database queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

## Expected Security Detections

Copilot should identify these vulnerability categories:

| **Vulnerability Type**     | **Detection**            | **Secure Alternative**    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Hardcoded Secrets**      | Pattern recognition      | Environment variables     |
| **SQL Injection**          | Query analysis           | Parameterized queries     |
| **Weak Cryptography**      | Algorithm identification | bcrypt/scrypt/Argon2      |
| **Input Validation**       | Flow analysis            | Comprehensive validation  |
| **Information Disclosure** | Error analysis           | Sanitized error responses |
| **Authentication Issues**  | Logic analysis           | Secure session management |

---

## Key Demo Messages

1. **"Security is built-in"** - Not an afterthought or separate process
2. **"Real-time protection"** - Vulnerabilities caught during development
3. **"Educational value"** - Developers learn secure coding practices
4. **"Comprehensive coverage"** - OWASP Top 10 and beyond

---

## Advanced Demo Options

For longer presentations, try these prompts:

- `Check this code for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities`
- `Analyze for timing attack vulnerabilities in authentication`
- `Check compliance with security frameworks (PCI DSS, SOC 2)`

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Copilot doesn't detect obvious vulnerabilities

- Make the vulnerable code more explicit
- Ask specific questions: "Is this SQL injection vulnerable?"
- Use security-focused prompts: "Review for security issues"

### If security suggestions are too generic

- Ask for specific implementations: "Show me the secure version"
- Request explanations: "Why is this approach more secure?"
- Ask for compliance guidance: "Make this PCI DSS compliant"

---

## Success Metrics

After this demo, your audience should understand:

- ✅ **Security is proactive** - Prevention vs detection
- ✅ **AI security knowledge is deep** - Not just pattern matching
- ✅ **Practical solutions provided** - Specific, actionable fixes
- ✅ **Development speed maintained** - Security without slowdown
- ✅ **Knowledge transfer happens** - Developers learn while coding

---

## Business Impact

**Risk Reduction**: 60-80% fewer security vulnerabilities
**Cost Savings**: Earlier detection = cheaper to fix
**Developer Education**: Built-in security knowledge transfer
**Compliance**: Automated adherence to security standards
