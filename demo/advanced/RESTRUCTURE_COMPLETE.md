# 🎉 Demo Restructure Complete!

## What We've Created

Your GitHub Copilot advanced demos are now **completely restructured** and **ready to run**!

### ✅ Problem Solved

**Before**: Demo files were instruction-heavy with no clear starting point

- Mixed instructions and code snippets
- No pre-setup files
- Unclear where to begin or how to prepare
- No ready-to-use examples

**After**: Each demo is now self-contained and ready-to-run

- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Pre-created setup files
- Exact prompts to copy-paste
- Expected results documentation
