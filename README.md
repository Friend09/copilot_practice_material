---

## 5 Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Learning Path**

   - **New to Copilot?** Start with `practice/beginner/01_hello_copilot/`
   - **Have experience?** Jump to `practice/advanced/` or try `hackathon/` challenges
   - **Want structured learning?** Follow the 30-day program in `docs/guides/`

2. **Set Up Your Environment**

   ```bash
   # Clone and open in VS Code
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/copilot_practice_material.git
   cd copilot_practice_material
   code _copilot_practice_material.code-workspace
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Fast path with uv
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Or classic pip/virtualenv
   python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify Copilot Setup**
   - Ensure the Copilot status icon (bottomâ€‘right) reads **"Copilot: ON"**
   - For agent mode: Command Palette â†’ **GitHub Copilot: Toggle Agent Mode**

## 6 Usage Patterns

- **Inline Suggestions** â€“ Type, accept with `Tab`, cycle variants with `Alt` + `[` / `Alt` + `]`
- **Copilot Chat** â€“ `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` (or chat icon) to open panel; ask questions
- **Agent Tasks** â€“ Switch chat panel to **Agent** mode; issue commands like:
  > _Fix issue #1 in `bugfix/buggy_code.py` and commit the changes._
- **Daily Practice** â€“ Spend 30-45 minutes daily with exercises and challenges

---

## 7 Best Practices

1. Write **clear, goalâ€‘oriented prompts**â€”context matters.
2. **Iterate.** Refine the prompt or ask Chat for alternatives if the first answer isn't right.
3. **Review & test** every suggestionâ€”you own correctness.
4. **Guard secrets & IP.** Never paste credentials into prompts.
5. **Limit agent scope.** Give explicit tasks and approve cautiously.
