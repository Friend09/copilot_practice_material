# Week 4 Project: Full-Stack Web Application

## Project Overview
Build a complete full-stack web application combining a React frontend with a Flask backend. This capstone project demonstrates mastery of GitHub Copilot across multiple technologies.

## Application Ideas

### Option 1: Personal Finance Tracker
- Track income and expenses
- Categorize transactions
- Generate spending reports
- Set budget goals

### Option 2: Recipe Management System
- Store and organize recipes
- Search by ingredients or cuisine
- Rate and review recipes
- Generate shopping lists

### Option 3: Project Management Tool
- Create and manage projects
- Assign tasks to team members
- Track progress and deadlines
- Generate project reports

## Technology Stack

### Frontend (React)
- React with functional components and hooks
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls
- Material-UI or Bootstrap for styling

### Backend (Flask)
- Flask with SQLAlchemy
- JWT authentication
- RESTful API design
- Database migrations

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Development (Days 1-3)
1. Set up Flask application structure
2. Design and implement database models
3. Create API endpoints with full CRUD operations
4. Implement authentication and authorization
5. Add input validation and error handling

### Phase 2: Frontend Development (Days 4-6)
1. Set up React application
2. Create component structure and routing
3. Implement user interface components
4. Connect to backend API
5. Add authentication flow

### Phase 3: Integration and Polish (Days 7-8)
1. Test full application flow
2. Handle edge cases and errors
3. Improve user experience
4. Add responsive design
5. Deploy application

## Copilot Usage Strategies

### Backend Prompts
- "Create a Flask route that handles user authentication with JWT tokens"
- "Implement a SQLAlchemy model for expense tracking with categories"
- "Add input validation for API endpoints using marshmallow"

### Frontend Prompts
- "Create a React component for displaying a list of transactions with edit/delete buttons"
- "Implement a form component for adding new expenses with validation"
- "Add authentication context and protected routes in React"

## Success Criteria

Your application should:
- ✅ Have a fully functional frontend and backend
- ✅ Include user authentication and authorization
- ✅ Perform all CRUD operations seamlessly
- ✅ Have responsive design for mobile and desktop
- ✅ Include proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Be deployable to a cloud platform
- ✅ Demonstrate advanced Copilot usage throughout

## Deployment Options

1. **Frontend**: Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages
2. **Backend**: Heroku, Railway, or DigitalOcean
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL on Heroku or Railway
