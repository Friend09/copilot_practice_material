# Beginner 02 – Data Fetch & Analysis

Fetch posts from **JSONPlaceholder** and report which user wrote the most.

## Steps

1. GET `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
2. Count posts per `userId`
3. Print the userId with the highest count

### Stretch

- Fetch `/users` to get the author name.
- Save the analysis to `analysis.txt`.

> Hint: install `requests` (`pip install requests`)
