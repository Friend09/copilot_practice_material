# Exercise 3 – Project Context & Custom APIs

You have a bespoke text‑to‑speech utility in **utils/speech_api.py**.

Task:

1. Read the API client class in `speech_api.py`.
2. In **main.py**, write a comment like:  
   `# Use TextToSpeechAPIClient to say 'Hello from Copilot'`
3. Observe Copilot generate the correct import and method calls.

Notice how having the file open provides Copilot with the context it needs.
