# Exercise 3: Constraint-Based Prompting

# Create a function to sort a list of integers.
# Constraints:
# - Must use the merge sort algorithm
# - Must be implemented recursively
# - Time complexity must be O(n log n)
# - Space complexity should be O(n)
# - Must handle empty lists and single-element lists
# - Must not modify the original list



# Create a function to find the shortest path in a graph.
# Constraints:
# - Must use Dijkstra's algorithm
# - Graph is represented as an adjacency list (dictionary)
# - Must return both the shortest distance and the path
# - Must handle disconnected nodes (return infinity for distance)
# - Must use a priority queue for efficiency
# - Function signature: shortest_path(graph, start, end)



# Create a class to implement a LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.
# Constraints:
# - Must have O(1) time complexity for get and put operations
# - Must use a combination of dictionary and doubly linked list
# - Maximum capacity should be configurable
# - Must evict least recently used item when capacity is exceeded
# - Must update access order on both get and put operations
# - Include methods: get(key), put(key, value), and size()



# Create a function to validate and parse JSON data.
# Constraints:
# - Must not use the built-in json module
# - Must handle strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects
# - Must raise specific exceptions for invalid JSON
# - Must support nested structures
# - Must handle escape sequences in strings
# - Return the parsed Python object



# Create a function to implement a thread-safe counter.
# Constraints:
# - Must use threading locks for synchronization
# - Must support increment, decrement, and get operations
# - Must handle multiple threads accessing simultaneously
# - Must not allow negative values (minimum is 0)
# - Must include a reset method
# - Must be implemented as a class with proper encapsulation



# Create a function to compress a string using run-length encoding.
# Constraints:
# - Must only compress if the result is shorter than the original
# - Must handle both uppercase and lowercase letters
# - Must return the original string if compression doesn't save space
# - Must use the format: character followed by count (e.g., "a3b2c1")
# - Must handle edge cases like empty strings
# - Time complexity must be O(n)
