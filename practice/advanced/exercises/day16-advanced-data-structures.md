# Day 16: Advanced Data Structures

## Objective

Today focuses on advanced data structures beyond basic lists, dictionaries, and sets. You will explore specialized data structures from the `collections` module, implement custom data structures, and understand when to use each one for optimal performance.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Advanced Collections

Explore specialized container datatypes from the `collections` module.

1.  **OrderedDict**: Create an OrderedDict that maintains insertion order and compare it with a regular dict.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Compare OrderedDict with regular dict behavior`
2.  **ChainMap**: Use ChainMap to combine multiple dictionaries and demonstrate lookup behavior.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Use ChainMap to combine multiple configuration dictionaries`
3.  **UserDict and UserList**: Create custom dictionary and list classes by inheriting from UserDict and UserList.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Create custom dictionary class inheriting from UserDict`
4.  **Counter Advanced Operations**: Use Counter for advanced counting operations like most_common, arithmetic operations.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Advanced Counter operations for text analysis`

### Exercise 2: Custom Data Structures

Implement custom data structures to understand their internal workings.

1.  **Stack Implementation**: Implement a stack using a list with push, pop, peek, and is_empty methods.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Implement a stack data structure with basic operations`
2.  **Queue Implementation**: Implement a queue using collections.deque with enqueue, dequeue, and is_empty methods.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Implement a queue data structure using deque`
3.  **Linked List**: Implement a simple singly linked list with insert, delete, and search operations.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Implement a singly linked list with basic operations`
4.  **Binary Tree**: Implement a basic binary tree with insert, search, and traversal methods.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Implement a binary tree with insert and traversal`
5.  **Hash Table**: Implement a simple hash table using lists and handle collisions with chaining.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Implement a hash table with collision handling`

### Exercise 3: Performance Analysis

Compare the performance characteristics of different data structures.

1.  **List vs Deque Performance**: Compare append and pop operations at both ends for list and deque.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Compare performance of list vs deque for append/pop operations`
2.  **Dictionary Lookup vs List Search**: Compare the time complexity of finding an element in a dict vs a list.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Compare dictionary lookup vs list search performance`
3.  **Set Operations Performance**: Measure the performance of set operations (union, intersection, difference).
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Measure performance of set operations`
4.  **Memory Usage Comparison**: Compare memory usage of different data structures for the same data.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Compare memory usage of different data structures`

### Exercise 4: Real-World Applications

Apply advanced data structures to solve practical problems.

1.  **LRU Cache**: Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache using OrderedDict.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Implement LRU cache using OrderedDict`
2.  **Graph Representation**: Implement a graph using adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Implement graph with adjacency list and matrix`
3.  **Priority Queue**: Implement a priority queue using the heapq module.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Implement priority queue using heapq`
4.  **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Implement a trie for efficient string prefix matching.
    -   *Prompting Hint*: `# Implement a trie for string prefix matching`

## Challenge Exercise: Data Structure Benchmark Suite

Create a comprehensive benchmark suite that:
-   Tests multiple data structures (list, deque, set, dict, custom implementations)
-   Measures performance for different operations (insert, delete, search, iterate)
-   Compares memory usage
-   Generates a performance report
-   Recommends the best data structure for different use cases

*Prompting Hint*: `# Create comprehensive benchmark suite for data structures`

## Reflection

-   How did Copilot help you understand the trade-offs between different data structures?
-   Were there any specific patterns Copilot suggested for implementing custom data structures?
-   How did the performance comparisons change your understanding of when to use each data structure?
