# Exercise 2: Persona and Step-by-Step Patterns

# You are an expert Python developer specializing in data analysis.
# Create a function that analyzes a list of sales data and provides insights.
# The function should:
# 1. Calculate the total sales amount
# 2. Find the average sale value
# 3. Identify the highest and lowest sales
# 4. Count the number of sales above the average
# 5. Return all results as a dictionary



# You are a senior software engineer with expertise in algorithm optimization.
# Create a function that implements binary search with the following requirements:
# 1. Take a sorted list and a target value as parameters
# 2. Use iterative approach (not recursive)
# 3. Return the index of the target if found, -1 if not found
# 4. Include detailed comments explaining each step
# 5. Handle edge cases like empty lists



# You are a database expert specializing in query optimization.
# Create a Python class that represents a simple in-memory database.
# The class should:
# 1. Store records as a list of dictionaries
# 2. Implement a method to insert new records
# 3. Implement a method to find records by field value
# 4. Implement a method to update records matching criteria
# 5. Implement a method to delete records matching criteria
# 6. Include proper error handling and validation



# You are a web development expert with deep knowledge of API design.
# Create a function that validates API request data.
# The function should:
# 1. Accept a dictionary of request data
# 2. Check for required fields (name, email, age)
# 3. Validate email format using regex
# 4. Ensure age is a positive integer between 18 and 120
# 5. Return a tuple: (is_valid: bool, errors: list)
# 6. Include specific error messages for each validation failure



# You are a machine learning engineer with expertise in data preprocessing.
# Create a function that preprocesses text data for natural language processing.
# The function should:
# 1. Convert text to lowercase
# 2. Remove punctuation and special characters
# 3. Remove extra whitespace
# 4. Split into individual words
# 5. Remove common stop words (the, and, or, but, in, on, at, to, for, of, with, by)
# 6. Return a list of cleaned words
