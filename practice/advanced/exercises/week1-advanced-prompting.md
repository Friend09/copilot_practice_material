# Week 1: Advanced Prompting Techniques

## Learning Objectives
- Master advanced prompt engineering techniques
- Practice few-shot prompting with examples
- Use persona, step-by-step, and constraint patterns
- Leverage multi-file context for complex tasks

## Exercise Overview
This week, you will move beyond basic prompts and learn to craft sophisticated prompts that give you more control over Copilot's output. These exercises will challenge you to think like a prompt engineer.

## Exercise 1: Few-Shot Prompting

**File**: `week1_exercise1.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Provide examples of input and expected output in comments.
2. Let Copilot infer the pattern and apply it to new inputs.
3. Practice with string manipulation, data transformation, and code refactoring.

**What to Practice**:
- Few-shot prompting for various tasks
- Providing clear and consistent examples
- Applying learned patterns to new data

## Exercise 2: Persona and Step-by-Step Patterns

**File**: `week1_exercise2.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Use the persona pattern to tell Copilot to act as an expert.
2. Break down complex tasks into numbered steps.
3. Combine both patterns for highly specific code generation.

**What to Practice**:
- Persona-based prompting
- Step-by-step instructions
- Combining multiple prompt patterns

## Exercise 3: Constraint-Based Prompting

**File**: `week1_exercise3.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Specify constraints for the generated code.
2. Include requirements for algorithms, data structures, and performance.
3. Challenge Copilot to generate code that meets specific criteria.

**What to Practice**:
- Specifying algorithmic constraints
- Performance requirements
- Code style and structure constraints

## Exercise 4: Multi-File Context

**Files**: `week1_exercise4_models.py`, `week1_exercise4_logic.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Create a simple data model in one file.
2. In a separate file, write prompts that require knowledge of the data model.
3. Observe how Copilot uses context from the other open file.

**What to Practice**:
- Leveraging multi-file context
- Workspace awareness
- Building modular code with Copilot's help

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Creative**: Experiment with different prompt combinations.
2. **Think Declaratively**: Describe *what* you want, not just *how* to do it.
3. **Review and Refine**: Iterate on your prompts to improve the results.
4. **Keep It Clean**: Well-structured comments lead to well-structured code.

## Next Steps

After this week, you should be proficient in advanced prompt engineering. Next week, we will focus on building small, real-world projects with Copilot.
