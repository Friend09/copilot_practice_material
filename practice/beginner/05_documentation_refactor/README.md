# Exercise 5 – Documentation & Refactor

`legacy_code.py` works but is hard to read and violates style guidelines.

Tasks:

1. Use Copilot **Chat** to _explain_ what the code does.
2. Ask Copilot Chat to suggest **refactorings** (e.g. clearer variable names, functions, or list comprehensions).
3. Apply the refactor with Copilot’s help.
4. Add docstrings and inline comments generated by Copilot.

Run the script before and after to ensure behavior stays the same.
