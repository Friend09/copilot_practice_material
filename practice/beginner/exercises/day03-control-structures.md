# Day 3: Control Structures and Logic

## Learning Objectives
- Master if/elif/else statements with Copilot
- Practice loop creation (for and while loops)
- Learn nested control structures
- Understand break and continue statements
- Practice exception handling basics

## Exercise Overview
Today focuses on control flow structures that make your programs dynamic and responsive. You'll learn how Copilot can help generate complex conditional logic and efficient loops.

## Exercise 1: Conditional Statements

**File**: `day03_exercise1.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Practice writing if/elif/else statements
2. Use Copilot to generate complex conditional logic
3. Learn about comparison operators and logical operators
4. Practice nested conditionals

**What to Practice**:
- Boolean expressions
- Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Nested if statements

## Exercise 2: For Loops and Iteration

**File**: `day03_exercise2.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Create various types of for loops
2. Practice iterating over different data structures
3. Use range() function effectively
4. Learn about enumerate() and zip() functions

**What to Practice**:
- Basic for loops
- Iterating over lists, strings, dictionaries
- Using range() with different parameters
- List comprehensions (if Copilot suggests them)

## Exercise 3: While Loops and Control Flow

**File**: `day03_exercise3.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Create while loops with proper conditions
2. Practice break and continue statements
3. Avoid infinite loops
4. Use while loops for user input validation

**What to Practice**:
- While loop conditions
- Break and continue statements
- Input validation patterns
- Loop counters and flags

## Exercise 4: Exception Handling

**File**: `day03_exercise4.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Learn basic try/except blocks
2. Handle specific exception types
3. Use finally blocks when appropriate
4. Practice defensive programming

**What to Practice**:
- Try/except/finally blocks
- Specific exception handling
- Error messages and logging
- Input validation with exceptions

## Tips for Success

1. **Clear Conditions**: Write descriptive comments about what conditions you're checking
2. **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Always ensure loop conditions can become false
3. **Use Meaningful Variable Names**: Especially for loop counters and flags
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Consider what happens with empty lists, zero values, etc.
5. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Use try/except for operations that might fail

## Common Control Structure Patterns

- "Check if the number is positive, negative, or zero"
- "Loop through each item in the list and..."
- "Continue asking for input until the user enters a valid value"
- "Handle the case where the file doesn't exist"

## Advanced Concepts to Explore

- List comprehensions and generator expressions
- Nested loops and their optimization
- Context managers (with statements)
- Custom exception classes

## Debugging Tips

When your control structures aren't working as expected:
1. Add print statements to track variable values
2. Check your indentation carefully
3. Verify your boolean logic with simple test cases
4. Use the debugger to step through your code

## Next Steps

After completing today's exercises, you should be comfortable with:
- Writing complex conditional statements
- Creating efficient loops
- Handling exceptions properly
- Controlling program flow effectively

Tomorrow, we'll explore working with data structures and file operations.
