# Exercise 3: While Loops and Control Flow

# 1. Create a function that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 100.
# Continue until they guess correctly. Use a while loop.



# 2. Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number using a while loop.



# 3. Create a function that finds the first Fibonacci number greater than a given value.



# 4. Create a function that validates user input for a menu choice.
# Keep asking until the user enters a valid option (1, 2, or 3).



# 5. Create a function that simulates a simple ATM withdrawal.
# Keep asking for withdrawal amount until it's valid (positive and <= balance).



# 6. Create a function that counts down from a given number to zero.
# Print each number and stop at zero.



# 7. Create a function that processes a list of numbers.
# Skip negative numbers (continue) and stop when encountering zero (break).



# 8. Create a function that finds the first prime number greater than a given number.



# 9. Test all functions with appropriate inputs.
