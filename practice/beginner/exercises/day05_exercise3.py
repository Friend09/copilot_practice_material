# Exercise 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism

# 1. Create a Vehicle base class with attributes for make, model, and year.
# Include methods for start_engine and stop_engine.



# 2. Create a Car class that inherits from Vehicle.
# Add attributes specific to cars (number_of_doors, fuel_type).



# 3. Override the start_engine method in the Car class to include car-specific behavior.



# 4. Create a Motorcycle class that inherits from Vehicle.
# Add attributes specific to motorcycles (has_sidecar, engine_size).



# 5. Override the start_engine method in the Motorcycle class.



# 6. Create an Animal base class with attributes for name and species.
# Include methods for make_sound and move.



# 7. Create a Dog class that inherits from Animal.
# Override make_sound to return "Woof!" and add a specific method like fetch.



# 8. Create a Cat class that inherits from Animal.
# Override make_sound to return "Meow!" and add a specific method like climb.



# 9. Create a Bird class that inherits from Animal.
# Override make_sound and move methods with bird-specific behavior.



# 10. Create a function that demonstrates polymorphism by calling make_sound
# on a list of different animal objects.



# 11. Create instances of all classes and test inheritance and method overriding.



# 12. Demonstrate polymorphism by treating different objects uniformly.
