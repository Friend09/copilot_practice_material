# Day 6: Modules and Packages

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to organize code into modules
- Learn to import and use modules effectively
- Practice creating custom modules and packages
- Explore Python's standard library modules
- Understand module search paths and best practices

## Exercise Overview
Today focuses on code organization and modularity. You'll learn how to break your code into reusable modules and packages, making your projects more maintainable and professional.

## Exercise 1: Creating and Using Custom Modules

**Files**: `day06_exercise1.py`, `math_utils.py`, `string_utils.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Create utility modules with related functions.
2. Practice different import syntaxes.
3. Understand module namespaces and scope.
4. Learn about the `if __name__ == "__main__":` pattern.

**What to Practice**:
- Module creation and organization
- Import statements (`import`, `from...import`, `as`)
- Module documentation
- Testing modules independently

## Exercise 2: Working with Standard Library Modules

**File**: `day06_exercise2.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Explore commonly used standard library modules.
2. Practice using `datetime`, `random`, `os`, `sys`, and `json` modules.
3. Learn to read module documentation.
4. Understand when to use built-in modules vs custom code.

**What to Practice**:
- Standard library exploration
- Module documentation reading
- Practical applications of common modules
- Best practices for using built-in functionality

## Exercise 3: Creating Packages

**Files**: Create a package structure with `__init__.py` files

**Instructions**:
1. Create a package directory structure.
2. Understand the role of `__init__.py` files.
3. Practice importing from packages.
4. Learn about relative and absolute imports.

**What to Practice**:
- Package structure creation
- `__init__.py` file usage
- Package imports
- Namespace packages

## Exercise 4: Module Best Practices and Advanced Topics

**File**: `day06_exercise4.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Learn about module search paths and `sys.path`.
2. Practice module reloading during development.
3. Understand circular imports and how to avoid them.
4. Create modules with proper error handling and logging.

**What to Practice**:
- Module search paths
- Import troubleshooting
- Code organization best practices
- Professional module structure

## Tips for Success

1. **Logical Organization**: Group related functions into the same module.
2. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names for modules and packages.
3. **Documentation**: Include docstrings for modules and functions.
4. **Testing**: Test modules independently before using them.
5. **Avoid Circular Imports**: Design your module dependencies carefully.

## Common Module Patterns

- "Create a utility module for..."
- "Import the math functions from..."
- "Organize these related functions into a package..."
- "Use the datetime module to..."

## Next Steps

After today, you should be comfortable organizing code into modules and packages. This completes the beginner fundamentals - you're ready to move on to more advanced topics and projects!
