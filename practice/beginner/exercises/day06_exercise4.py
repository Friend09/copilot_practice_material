# Exercise 4: Module Best Practices and Advanced Topics

import sys
import importlib

# 1. Print the current module search path (sys.path).



# 2. Create a function that dynamically imports a module by name.



# 3. Create a module that handles its own import errors gracefully.
# Try importing an optional dependency and provide fallback functionality.



# 4. Create a configuration module that loads settings from environment variables.
# Use the os module to read environment variables with default values.



# 5. Create a logging utility module that sets up logging for other modules.
# Use the logging module to create formatted log messages.



# 6. Create a module that demonstrates proper exception handling.
# Include custom exception classes and proper error messages.



# 7. Create a module with both public and private functions.
# Use naming conventions to indicate which functions are internal.



# 8. Create a module that can be used both as a library and as a command-line script.
# Use the if __name__ == "__main__": pattern effectively.



# 9. Create a module that validates its own dependencies on import.
# Check for required modules and provide helpful error messages if missing.



# 10. Demonstrate how to reload a module during development using importlib.reload().



# 11. Create a module that uses __all__ to control what gets imported with "from module import *".



# 12. Create a comprehensive example that shows professional module organization,
# documentation, error handling, and testing.
