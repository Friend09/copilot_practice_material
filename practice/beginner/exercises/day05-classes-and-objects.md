# Day 5: Classes and Objects (Object-Oriented Programming)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Learn to create classes and instantiate objects
- Practice defining methods and attributes
- Understand constructors (`__init__`) and special methods
- Learn about inheritance and method overriding

## Exercise Overview
Today introduces Object-Oriented Programming concepts. You'll learn to create classes that model real-world entities and understand how Copilot can help generate class structures, methods, and inheritance hierarchies.

## Exercise 1: Basic Classes and Objects

**File**: `day05_exercise1.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Create simple classes with attributes and methods.
2. Practice instantiating objects and calling methods.
3. Use the `__init__` constructor to initialize object state.
4. Implement `__str__` method for string representation.

**What to Practice**:
- Class definition syntax
- Constructor methods
- Instance attributes and methods
- Object instantiation

## Exercise 2: Class Methods and Properties

**File**: `day05_exercise2.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Create classes with various types of methods.
2. Practice using class variables vs instance variables.
3. Implement getter and setter methods.
4. Use property decorators for cleaner attribute access.

**What to Practice**:
- Instance vs class variables
- Method types (instance, class, static)
- Property decorators
- Encapsulation concepts

## Exercise 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism

**File**: `day05_exercise3.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Create parent and child classes using inheritance.
2. Override methods in child classes.
3. Use `super()` to call parent class methods.
4. Understand polymorphism through method overriding.

**What to Practice**:
- Class inheritance
- Method overriding
- Using `super()`
- Polymorphic behavior

## Exercise 4: Special Methods and Advanced OOP

**File**: `day05_exercise4.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Implement special methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, etc.).
2. Create classes that work with built-in functions.
3. Practice composition (classes containing other classes).
4. Implement comparison methods.

**What to Practice**:
- Special/magic methods
- Object comparison
- Composition vs inheritance
- Making objects work with built-in functions

## Tips for Success

1. **Think in Objects**: Model real-world entities as classes.
2. **Clear Responsibilities**: Each class should have a single, clear purpose.
3. **Descriptive Names**: Use meaningful names for classes, methods, and attributes.
4. **Documentation**: Write docstrings for classes and methods.
5. **Test Your Classes**: Create objects and test all methods.

## Common OOP Patterns to Practice

- "Create a class that represents..."
- "Implement a method that calculates/processes..."
- "Add validation to ensure..."
- "Create a child class that extends..."

## Next Steps

After today, you should understand basic OOP concepts and be able to create well-structured classes. Tomorrow, we'll explore modules and packages for organizing larger codebases.
