# Exercise 4: Special Methods and Advanced OOP

# 1. Create a Point class with x and y coordinates.
# Implement __str__, __repr__, and __eq__ methods.



# 2. Add methods to the Point class for calculating distance to another point.



# 3. Implement __add__ method to add two points together.



# 4. Create a Temperature class that can represent temperature in Celsius.
# Implement comparison methods (__lt__, __gt__, __eq__).



# 5. Add methods to convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.



# 6. Create a Playlist class that contains a list of songs.
