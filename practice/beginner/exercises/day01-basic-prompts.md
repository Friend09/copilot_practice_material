# Day 1: Basic Prompts and Code Generation

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to write effective comments for Copilot
- Practice basic code generation from natural language
- Learn to accept, reject, and cycle through suggestions
- Get comfortable with Copilot's interface in VS Code

## Exercise Overview
Today's exercises focus on the fundamentals of interacting with GitHub Copilot. You'll learn how to write clear, descriptive comments that help Copilot understand your intent and generate appropriate code.

## Exercise 1: Simple Function Generation

**File**: `day01_exercise1.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Open the provided Python file
2. Read each comment carefully
3. Position your cursor at the end of each comment
4. Press Enter and wait for Copilot's suggestion
5. Accept the suggestion with Tab if it looks correct
6. If the suggestion isn't what you want, press Esc and try rephrasing the comment

**What to Practice**:
- Writing clear, descriptive comments
- Accepting suggestions with Tab
- Rejecting suggestions with Esc
- Understanding how comment clarity affects suggestions

## Exercise 2: Variable and Data Structure Creation

**File**: `day01_exercise2.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Practice creating variables with descriptive names
2. Use comments to describe what each variable should contain
3. Let Copilot suggest appropriate data types and initial values
4. Try creating lists, dictionaries, and other data structures

**What to Practice**:
- Variable naming conventions
- Data structure creation
- Type hints (if Copilot suggests them)

## Exercise 3: Basic Calculations

**File**: `day01_exercise3.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Write comments describing mathematical operations
2. Let Copilot generate the calculation code
3. Practice with different types of calculations (arithmetic, comparisons, etc.)

**What to Practice**:
- Mathematical operations
- Comparison operators
- Basic Python syntax

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your comments, the better Copilot's suggestions
2. **Use Natural Language**: Write comments as if explaining to a colleague
3. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic operations before moving to complex logic
4. **Experiment**: Try different ways of phrasing the same request
5. **Review Suggestions**: Always read and understand the generated code

## Common Patterns That Work Well

- "Create a function that..."
- "Calculate the..."
- "Define a variable that stores..."
- "Initialize a list of..."
- "Check if..."

## Troubleshooting

If Copilot isn't providing suggestions:
1. Make sure the extension is enabled
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try pressing Alt+\ to manually trigger suggestions
4. Ensure your comment is clear and specific

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises, you should feel comfortable with:
- Writing effective prompts for Copilot
- Accepting and rejecting suggestions
- Basic code generation patterns

Tomorrow, we'll move on to more complex function creation and parameter handling.
