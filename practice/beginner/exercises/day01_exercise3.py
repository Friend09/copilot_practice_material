# Exercise 3: Basic Calculations

# 1. Calculate the area of a rectangle with width 10 and height 5.



# 2. Calculate the area of a circle with radius 7. Use 3.14159 for pi.



# 3. Calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides 3 and 4.
# Use the Pythagorean theorem: c² = a² + b²



# 4. Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
# Formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32
# Convert 25 degrees Celsius.



# 5. Calculate the compound interest for an investment.
# Principal: $1000, Rate: 5% per year, Time: 3 years
# Formula: A = P(1 + r)^t



# 6. Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI).
# Weight: 70 kg, Height: 1.75 meters
# Formula: BMI = weight / (height²)



# 7. Calculate the distance between two points.
# Point 1: (0, 0), Point 2: (3, 4)
# Formula: distance = √((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²)



# 8. Print all calculated results with descriptive labels.
