# Exercise 1: Simple Function Generation

# 1. Create a function that adds two numbers.
# The function should be named `add_numbers` and take two arguments, `a` and `b`.
# It should return their sum.



# 2. Create a function that subtracts two numbers.
# The function should be named `subtract_numbers` and take two arguments, `a` and `b`.
# It should return their difference.



# 3. Create a function that multiplies two numbers.
# The function should be named `multiply_numbers` and take two arguments, `a` and `b`.
# It should return their product.



# 4. Create a function that divides two numbers.
# The function should be named `divide_numbers` and take two arguments, `a` and `b`.
# It should return their quotient. Handle division by zero by returning an error message.



# 5. Call each function with example values and print the results.
