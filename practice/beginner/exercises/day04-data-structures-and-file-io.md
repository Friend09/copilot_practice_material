# Day 4: Data Structures and File I/O

## Learning Objectives
- Master working with Python lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- Understand when to use each data structure
- Practice reading from and writing to text files
- Learn basic CSV file operations

## Exercise Overview
Today, you'll deepen your understanding of Python's fundamental data structures and learn how to interact with files. Copilot will assist you in generating code for common data manipulation and file handling tasks.

## Exercise 1: Lists and Tuples

**File**: `day04_exercise1.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Practice creating, accessing, modifying, and iterating over lists.
2. Learn about common list methods (append, insert, remove, sort).
3. Create and use tuples, understanding their immutability.
4. Use Copilot to generate list comprehensions and tuple packing/unpacking.

**What to Practice**:
- List creation and manipulation
- Tuple definition and usage
- List comprehensions
- Tuple packing and unpacking

## Exercise 2: Dictionaries and Sets

**File**: `day04_exercise2.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Practice creating, accessing, modifying, and iterating over dictionaries.
2. Learn about common dictionary methods (keys, values, items, get).
3. Create and use sets, understanding their unique element property.
4. Practice set operations (union, intersection, difference).

**What to Practice**:
- Dictionary creation and manipulation
- Set definition and operations
- Dictionary comprehensions
- Efficient data lookup

## Exercise 3: Reading and Writing Text Files

**File**: `day04_exercise3.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Practice opening and closing text files.
2. Read file content line by line and all at once.
3. Write content to new and existing files.
4. Use `with open(...)` for safe file handling.

**What to Practice**:
- File opening modes (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`)
- Reading file content (`.read()`, `.readline()`, `.readlines()`)
- Writing file content (`.write()`, `.writelines()`)
- Context managers for file handling

## Exercise 4: Basic CSV File Operations

**File**: `day04_exercise4.py`

**Instructions**:
1. Use the `csv` module to read and write CSV files.
2. Practice reading data into a list of dictionaries.
3. Write data from a list of dictionaries to a CSV file.
4. Handle CSV headers and delimiters.

**What to Practice**:
- Reading CSV files with `csv.reader` and `csv.DictReader`
- Writing CSV files with `csv.writer` and `csv.DictWriter`
- Handling CSV headers
- Basic data parsing from CSV

## Tips for Success

1. **Choose the Right Structure**: Think about the best data structure for your problem.
2. **Error Handling**: Anticipate file-related errors (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`).
3. **Resource Management**: Always close files or use `with` statements.
4. **Descriptive Comments**: Guide Copilot with comments about the data you're handling.

## Next Steps

After today, you should be comfortable with Python's core data structures and basic file I/O. Tomorrow, we'll move on to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
