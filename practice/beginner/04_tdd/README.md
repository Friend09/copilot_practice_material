# Exercise 4 – Test‑Driven Development (TDD)

The tests in **test_math_utils.py** are failing.  
Implement the missing functions in **math_utils.py** so that all tests pass.

* Open the test file to understand the expected behavior.
* Edit `math_utils.py`, using Copilot suggestions as you type.
* Run the tests with:

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

Repeat until the tests pass.
