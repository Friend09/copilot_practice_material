# Exercise 1 – Hello Copilot

1. Open **hello.py**.
2. Place the cursor below the docstring and type the comment:

```python
# print Hello, World!
```

3. Observe Copilot’s suggestion for a `print()` statement and accept it with **Tab**.
4. Run the script (`python hello.py`) to verify the output.

Feel free to experiment with different single‑line comments to see alternative suggestions.
